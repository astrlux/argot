# Argot

argot (noun): the jargon or slang of a particular group or class.

### Who's this for?

Do you frequently write technical documentation in Vim with `set spell spelllang=<...>` and suffer "spelling errors" which aren't actually spelling errors? It's just domain-specific jargon that your `spelllang` has zero support for.

> e.g. "memcache", "NeuralNet", "softmax", "CNNs", "MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", etc.

Marking terminology as spelling mistakes is a subpar UX.
